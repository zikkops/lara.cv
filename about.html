            I am a highly motivated individual with an optimistic personality
            who currently holds over 5 years of experience with clients in the
            Middle-East; catering to their needs as an English/Arabic
            copywriter, translator, and creative writer.

          <h2>
            It’s a fact, Copywriters don’t like to talk about themselves. <br />
            We usually prefer to talk about you, your company and products,
            <br />
            but here’s my story…
          </h2>
        </div>
        <div id="start-story">
          <p>
            It all started when my friends at college needed help with their
            projects, while I was studying Applied Linguistics, pursuing my
            passion for languages. <br /><br />

            As I helped them with their projects; searching, editing, and
            finding the right words, I realized that I’m a struggling college
            student, why not start charging for my words and ideas? <br /><br />

            Word got out that I’m good with words (and grammar, too!).
            <br /><br />

            In the Spring of 2015, I was approached by a small business owner
            looking for help with editing and translating some documents for his
            advertising agency “Origin”, I applied to be their translator, but
            he spotted a better use for me and hired me as a copywriter.

        <img src="/img/about-third.png" alt="" />
        <div class="about-second-banner">
          <h2>
            That’s when I became a Copywriter, without even knowing I wanted to
            be one.
          </h2>
        </div>
        <div id="second-story">
          <p>
            Onwards, I started advertising my skills, applying for other
            copywriting jobs and undertaking small freelance projects.<br /><br />

            In 2019, I was hired as an Arabic copywriter for Omnicom Media Group
            to help with Majid Al Futtaim City Centre accounts in UAE, Oman,
            Bahrain, and Lebanon. <br /><br />

            The psychology, the marketing, and communicating with different
            cultures got to me; I wanted more (Yes! I’m selfish that way), I
            wanted to understand more about people, their ways of thinking,
            their problems and how to solve them.

            This is why I ventured in the world of International Commercial
            Negotiations where I pursued my Masters, and OH MY, what a world;
            different cultures, behaviors, business ethics, traditions,
            relationships, communications, and ideologies.<br /><br />

            Learning about all these new cultures made me realize how different
            we are, how each individual is unique, and I learned how to apply
            this in my copywriting.
